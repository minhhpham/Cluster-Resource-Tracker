# RESOURCE TRACKING FOR COMPUTER CLUSTERS
This project is created to serve users of computer clusters where ssh-ing to a compute node is not allowed. The tools in this repository will allow users to track resources in compute nodes without using ssh.

Currently, supported resources are:
 - CPU usage (through Linux' `ps` command)
 - Memory usage (through Linux' `ps` command)
 - GPU usage (through `nvidia-smi` command)

## HOW TO INSTALL AND SETUP
### In Control Node/Head Node



### In Compute Node
```
